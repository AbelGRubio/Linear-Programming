A refiner can buy light crude oil and heavy crude oil. The cost per barrel of
these types of oil is 11 and 9 euros, respectively. From each type of oil are produced
per barrel the following quantities of gasoline, kerosene and jet fue


|                 | gasoline | kerosene | jet fue |
|-----------------|----------|----------|---------|
| light crude oil | 0.4      | 0.2      | 0.35    |
| heavy crude oil | 0.32     | 0.4      | 0.2     |

In the refining process, 5% and 8% of the crude oil is lost, respectively. The refinery has
a contract to deliver one million barrels of gasoline, four hundred thousand barrels of kerosene, and
two hundred and fifty thousand barrels of jet fuel. Determine the number of barrels of
each type of crude oil that meet demand while minimizing cost.
